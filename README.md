# DBSCAN

Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise

DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm: given a set of points in some space, it groups together points that are closely packed together (points with many nearby neighbors), marking as outliers points that lie alone in low-density regions (whose nearest neighbors are too far away). [Wikipedia link](1)

This is an implementation of the algorithm in rust-stable.
